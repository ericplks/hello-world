**Planning architecture sketch**

Okay, I need to create an architecture sketch. I want to keep it concise but still structured, so it’s clear and useful. I’ll avoid being too verbose, but I don’t want to leave out important details. It’s a balancing act, really. I’ll focus on the key elements and make sure it’s easy to follow. No need for citations here, just a clean, straightforward sketch. Let’s get started!
You’re asking the right question—that’s where Fabric really starts to either sing or become a mess.

Here’s a clean, opinionated architecture you can use as a starting point.

---

### 1. Core principles

- **Store once, share many:** All “official” data lives in a small number of **domain workspaces**, not in report workspaces.
- **Separation of concerns:**  
  - Domain workspaces → own and produce data  
  - Consumer/report workspaces → use data, don’t own it  
- **Shortcuts, not copies:** Any time you feel like “importing” the same data twice, stop and use a **shortcut** or **shared semantic model** instead.
- **Least privilege:** Users only get access to what they actually need—at workspace and folder/table level.

### 2. Workspace types

**1️⃣ Platform / Landing workspaces**

- **Purpose:** Raw ingestion from source systems.
- **Examples:**  
  - `PLT_Landing_ERP`  
  - `PLT_Landing_CRM`
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Raw, unmodeled data  
  - Very restricted access (data engineers only)  
  - Not used directly by BI

---

**2️⃣ Domain workspaces (Gold / Curated)**

- **Purpose:** Authoritative, reusable data for the business.
- **Examples:**  
  - `DM_Sales`  
  - `DM_Finance`  
  - `DM_Operations`
- **Contents:**  
  - Lakehouses (Bronze/Silver/Gold folders)  
  - Warehouses  
  - Semantic models (Power BI datasets)
- **Access:**  
  - Data engineers + domain data stewards  
  - Read access for analysts who need curated data  
- **Rule:**  
  - This is where “truth” lives.  
  - Anything reused across teams should be here.

---

**3️⃣ Consumer / Report workspaces**

- **Purpose:** Team- or project-specific reporting and self-service.
- **Examples:**  
  - `APP_Sales_Analytics`  
  - `APP_Finance_Reporting`  
  - `APP_Exec_Dashboards`
- **Contents:**  
  - Reports, dashboards  
  - Thin semantic models (if needed)  
  - Shortcuts to domain data (or shared semantic models)
- **Access:**  
  - Wider audience (business users, stakeholders)  
- **Rule:**  
  - No heavy data prep here.  
  - No duplicated tables.  
  - Consume, don’t own.

### 3. How data flows

**Step 1: Source → Platform**

- Ingest raw data into `PLT_*` workspaces.
- Keep it as close to source as possible.

**Step 2: Platform → Domain**

- Use pipelines / notebooks to transform into curated tables in `DM_*` workspaces.
- Organize by layers, e.g.:

  - `/Bronze` → raw-ish  
  - `/Silver` → cleaned, conformed  
  - `/Gold` → business-ready, KPI-level

**Step 3: Domain → Consumer**

- In consumer workspaces, **never copy data**.
- Instead, use:
  - **Shortcuts** to `DM_*` lakehouses/warehouses  
  - Or **shared semantic models** from `DM_*` workspaces

### 4. Permissions model

**Platform workspaces**

- **Who:** Data engineers only  
- **Why:** Protect raw data, avoid misuse

**Domain workspaces**

- **Owners:** Data engineering + domain owners  
- **Readers:** Analysts, BI devs who build on curated data  
- **Folder-level security:**  
  - E.g. `/Gold/Restricted` for sensitive data  
  - Use AD groups per domain/role

**Consumer workspaces**

- **Owners:** BI/report developers  
- **Viewers:** Business users  
- **No direct access to Platform**  
- Only see what’s exposed via domain workspaces.

---

### 5. Using shortcuts cleanly

- **From consumer to domain:**
  - `APP_Sales_Analytics` → shortcut to `DM_Sales` `/Gold` folder
- **Different data for different consumers:**
  - Use folder-level security in `DM_Sales`:
    - `/Gold/Internal`  
    - `/Gold/External`  
  - Give different groups access to different folders; same shortcut path, different visibility.

---

### 6. Naming & governance tips

- **Prefix by type:** `PLT_`, `DM_`, `APP_`
- **Use domains, not systems:** `DM_Sales` instead of `DM_SAP`
- **Define ownership:** Each domain workspace has:
  - **Data owner** (business)  
  - **Tech owner** (engineering)
- **Document contracts:** What each `DM_*` workspace guarantees (SLAs, refresh, definitions).

If you tell me your main domains (e.g. Sales, Finance, HR) and team structure, I can sketch a concrete version tailored to your org instead of this generic pattern.
